```

### Job Flow Example

1. **User submits:** GitHub username
2. **API creates jobs:**
   - Job #1: Fetch profile (priority: 10)
   - Job #2: Fetch repositories (priority: 9)
3. **Worker processes:** Fetches 25 repositories
4. **API creates 25 analysis jobs:** One per repo (priority: 5)
5. **Workers process in parallel:** 3 workers analyzing simultaneously
6. **Final job:** Generate portfolio (priority: 1)
7. **User receives:** Complete analysis with rankings

## 🔑 Key Technical Highlights

### 1. Custom Priority Queue
Implemented from scratch using a min-heap for O(log n) operations:
- Efficient job prioritization
- Database-backed persistence
- Race condition handling with PostgreSQL locks

### 2. Distributed Worker Architecture
- Multiple worker processes running concurrently
- Job deduplication using `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
- Graceful error handling and retry logic
- Exponential backoff for failed jobs

### 3. GitHub API Integration
- Rate limiting with intelligent backoff
- Pagination handling for large datasets
- Authentication with personal access tokens
- Caching to minimize API calls

### 4. Ranking Algorithm
Multi-factor scoring system considering:
- Repository engagement (stars, forks)
- Documentation quality (README score)
- Project activity and recency
- Code quality indicators (tests, CI/CD)
- Originality (not forked)
